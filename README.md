# HomeREST

Home REST app is a Proof of Concept application for testing 
serverless or webapp deployment of the same code. 

It was successfully launched as a tomcat9x application as well
as a gretty instance: embedded jetty standalone server. 

For persistence it relies Hibernate ORM for H2 or MySQL databases. 

    The POC shows how to call REST testing from different sides: 
    from API endpoints and from JUnit tests. The tests are written 
    in JUnit5 and Java. Some Kotlin testing base is introduced.
